"Jarurat ho toh pyar hota hai mtlb jarurat bnane ke liye jo pyar mn rakhte hn uska kya ??
Rishte mein toh jarurat honr pr value milta h pr pyar mn aisa nhi hota 
Jab samne wala pyar krta hai ya krti hai toh woh jo bolta h ta bolti h krte krte hn ya krba parta hai kyunki woh hamara pyar hota hai 

Pyar mein pucho ke jarurat hn toh bhi nhi batate 
Agr pucho pyar krte ho toh bhi nhi batate 
Hum aakhir kya hn yeh bhi nhi pta hota , aur value toh hota hi nhi"

Ya Fir Aabaad Kardo
Ya Toh Barbad Kardo
Ya Fir Aaabad Kardo

Wo Galat Tha Ye Sahi Hai
Jhooth Ye Aaj Kehdo
Itna Ehsaan Kardo

Itna Ehsaan Kardo
Poore Armaan Kardo
Lab Pe Aake Jo Ruke Hai
Dhayi Wo Harf Kehdo

Meri Saanson Se Judi Hai
Teri Har Saans Kehdo
Mushqil Aasaan Kardo

Mushqil Aasaan Kardo
Ya Toh Barbaad Kardo
Ya Fir Abaad Kardo
Ya Toh Barbaad Kardo

Meetha Sa Ye Zehar
Main Toh Peeta Rahunga
Tu Khuda Na Sahi
Main Toh Sajde Karunga

Hmm.. Meetha Sa Ye Zehar
Main Toh Peeta Rahunga
Tu Khuda Na Sahi
Main Toh Sajde Karunga

Tum Jo Seeri Na Hue Kya
Humko Farhaar Kardo
Meri Saanson Se Judi Hai
Teri Har Saans Kehdo
Mushqil Aasaan Kardo

Ya Toh Barbad Kardo
Ya Fir Aabaad Kardo
Ya Toh Barbaad Kardo

Khwabon Ko Jagah Na Mili Aankho Mein
Wahan Pehle Se Shailab Tha
Nagmein Banata Fira Saazon Pe
Dil Apna Fakhat Mizraab Tha

Khwabon Ko Jagah Na Mili Aankho Mein
Wahan Pehle Se Shailab Tha
Nagmein Banata Fira Saazon Pe
Dil Apna Fakhat Mijraab Tha

Meri Bejaan Harsraton Ko
Kaabiledaar Kardo
Meri Saanson Se Judi Hai
Teri Har Saans Kehdo
Itna Ehsaan Kardo

Itna Ehsaan Kardo
Poore Armaan Kardo
Ya Toh Barbaad Kardo
Ya Fir Aabad Kardo"

Kon kon ya song 2023 ma sunn rha h
"rajkumar rao is just perfect in every role and i always feel that he is living or i am living his rple in real life 
i dont understand why do girls always choice the wrong guy 
you give your 100% but they dont see that and always go for the wrong

"Why people forget so easily every good thing happened in the past. Why does it holds no more real value. Going by this..even the present will become past after this time passes away. By this logic every happy moment, every relationship holds no value. Is it so?"

"Beautiful moments are attached with this song ,
Nostalgic vibes comes out while listening to this ........"
"John 5: 24. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and will not come into condemnation, but has passed from destruction to life. Hearing the word of God and believing, according to this text, means accepting Jesus as the only and sufficient savior, reading the bible, attending an evangelical church and practicing the commandments of God as soon as you learn. Condemnation comes from sin, and through sin it entered the world. Sin generates condemnation, which in turn leads the person without Jesus to perdition (suffering). Sin entered the world through Adam, but it is removed through Jesus who paid a heavy price on the cross for us. He did his part, now we have to do our part. He's calling you, are you coming? Don't delay, tomorrow may be too late for you. Hugs!"
"Loved this song back in 2020.
Came back again today ❤️"

"This movie is a directorial masterpiece. In the song only, the amount of thoughts and ideas that are put together is much more than compared to another movie itself. The music, set and camera work altogether created magic. From the glimpse of Abhishek Bachchan watching the house to Rajkumar Rao's memories transition is so perfect to watch."

Hmm..

Meetha Sa Yeh Zehar

Wahan Pehle Se Shailaab Tha
Nagmein Banata Phira Saajon Pe
Dil Apna Fakt Mizrab Tha

Meri Bejaan Harsraton Ko
Qaabil-E-Daar Kar Do
Meri Saanson Se Joodi Hai
Teri Har Saans Keh Do
Itna Ehsaan Kar Do

Itna Ehsaan Kar Do
Poore Armaan Kard Do

Who suddenly remember this song and came here to listen 😂😻

"All the four stories are about second chances , 
One about a father who just wants to spend time with his daughter 
Another is about a idiotic fool who is still in love with his childhood friend and who cannot accept to move on in life. 
Third is about two broke teens who are completely under the paws of the cruel city which only respects those who have money. 
Last but not the least 4th is about 2 friends who gave up love for money or either career but little did they know that the love they had for each other did not give up on them. 
Life does give second chances and uskee aaabaad hoone see pehlee barbaad hoona bahut zarurii hai"

"Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do

Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do
Ya Phir Aabad Kar Do
Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do
Ya Phir Aabad Kar Do

Woh Ghalat Tha Ye Sahi Hai
Jhooth Ye Aaj Keh Do

Itna Ehsaan Kar Do
Itna Ehsaan Kar Do
Poore Armaan Kar Do

Lab Pe Aakar Jo Ruke Hai
Dhaai Woh Harf Keh Do

Meri Saanson Se Judi Hai
Teri Har Saans Keh Do
Mushkil Aasaan Kar Do

Kar Do..

Mushkil Asaan Kar Do
Ya To Barbaad Kar Do
Ya Phir Abaad Kar Do
Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do

Meetha Sa Yeh Zeher
Main Toh Peeta Rahunga
Tu Khuda Na Sahi
Main Toh Sajde Karunga

Hmm..

Meetha Sa Yeh Zehar
Main Toh Peeta Rahunga
Tu Khuda Na Sahi
Main Toh Sajde Karunga

Tum Jo Shirin Na Huye Kya
Humko Farhaar Kar Do

Meri Saanson Se Judi Hai
Teri Har Saans Keh Do
Mushkil Aasaan Kar Do

Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do
Ya Phir Aabaad Kar Do
Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do

Kar Do…

Khaabon Ko Jagah Na Mili Aankhon Mein
Wahan Pehle Se Sailaab Tha
Nagmein Banata Phira Saajon Pe
Dil Apna Fakt Mizrab Tha

Hmm…

Khaabon Ko Jagah Na Mili Aankhon Mein
Wahan Pehle Se Shailaab Tha
Nagmein Banata Phira Saajon Pe
Dil Apna Fakt Mizrab Tha

Meri Bejaan Harsraton Ko
Qaabil-E-Daar Kar Do
Meri Saanson Se Joodi Hai
Teri Har Saans Keh Do
Itna Ehsaan Kar Do

Kar Do..

Itna Ehsaan Kar Do
Poore Armaan Kard Do
Ya Toh Barbaad Kar Do
Ya Phir Abad Kar Do"

Красивая песня
"When I proposed her for the first time and she didn't say anything, (I knew it was a NO) I was listening to this song, and stopped listening to this song when got together. In a relationship. Now when she deserted, I am back to listening to this song once again.. I remember once I asked her, if she can guess what song I have been listening on loop since past 3 days , all the time.. and she asked me she's been listening to a song past 3 days too, then She took out her Phone and then opened the  Spotify, we both did actually at the same time.. and guess what, this was this song.. Aabaad Barbaad, but the sad part she was listening this song for someone else and I was listening for her."
Love this song....
The legend Arjit Singh 😘

Khuabo ko jaga na mili ankho main waha pehly se hee selaab tha🤭🤭🤭❤️❤️❤️
"Khwab : (dream)

Sailaab : (flood)

Naghma : (sur,    singing on the rhythm of music)

 Saaz : (music)

Faqat : (only)

Mizraab : ( tool that is being used for beating drum or santoor or anything that creates musical sound)

Be jaan : (useless)

Hasrat : (desire) 

Qabil-e-daad : (praiseworthy)

I think, In this song word ""mizraab"" was used to define the situation of the character which was played by raj kumar rao, because his love just used him to fullfill her wishes,

Just like drumstick which is being used for creating the musical sound !!


Director has blown my mind by putting this kind of meaningful depth in the movie, and specially in this song !!!!!!!
Just mind blowing, wooooooow !!!"
I am leaving a comment in hope that whenever someone like it. I will be reminded of this masterpiece.

خوابوں کو جگہ نہ ملی آنکھوں میں
وہاں پہلے سے ہی سیلاب تھا
نغمے بناتا پھرا سازوں پہ
دل اپنا فقط مضراب تھا
میری بےجا حسرتوں کو
قابل داد کر دو!
the lyrics are pure gold"
"The lyrics!!!!!! Each word is gem, beautifully set into this masterpiece."

"Ya to barbaad kar do
Ya phir aabaad kar do
Wo galat tha yeh sahi hai
Jhooth yeh aaj keh do
Itna ehsaan kar do
Poore armaan kar do
Lab pe aakar jo ruke hain
Dhai wo harf keh do
Meri saanson se judi hai
Teri har saans keh do
Mushqil aasaan kar do
Ya to barbaad kar do
Ya phir aabaad kar do
Meetha sa yeh zehar
Main to peeta rahunga
Tu khuda na sahi
Main to sajde karunga
Meetha sa yeh zehar
Main to peeta rahunga
Tu khuda na sahi
Main to sajde karunga
Tum jo sheerin na huye kya
Humko farhaad kar do
Meri saanson se judi hai
Teri har saans keh do
Mushqil aasaan kar do
Ya to barbaad kar do
Ya phir aabaad kar do
Khwabon ko jagah na mili aankhon mein
Wahaan pehle se hi sailaab tha
Nagme banaata phira saazo pe
Dil apna faqat mizraab thha
Meri bejaan hasraton ko
Kaabile-daar kar do
Meri saanson se judi hai
Teri har saans keh do
Itna ehsaan kar do
Itna ehsaan kar do
Poore armaan kar do
Ya to barbaad kar do
Ya phir aabaad kar do"
